  ♻️ Recycling Platform
</h1>

We are trying to raise awareness to the importance of recycling. This is a Google Solution Challenge 2023 project that uses Firebase (authentication, analytics, firestore and storage) as well as latest technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion to ensure best user experience.

## Quick start

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your system. Node.js comes with a package manager called `npm` but I suggest you use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) instead since it's faster and more efficient.

1. Clone the repository:
   - `git clone https://github.com/eggsy/recycling-platform`
2. Install dependencies:
   - `pnpm install` or `npm install`
3. Create a Firestore account and get required fileds in `.env.example` file.
4. Fill in the required fields and rename it to `.env.local`.
5. Run the app:
   - `pnpm run dev` or `npm run dev` for development mode.
   - `<pnpm/npm> run build` and `<pnpm/npm> start` for production mode.
