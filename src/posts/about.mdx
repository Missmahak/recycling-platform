title: About the Project
---

This platform was created for the 2023 Solution Challenge of Google to raise awareness of the importance of the recycling through gamification, visuals and information available on the website. The information is gathered from various sources and the platform is designed to be easily accessible and usable on mobile devices.

While creating the platform, we used the following technologies:

- React.js & Next.js
- PWA (offline access, push notifications)
- Firebase (authentication, firestore, file hosting)
- Google Analytics
- Netlify (hosting)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Framer Motion (animations)
- [Filepond](https://pqina.nl)
- Google Domains
