title: About the Project
---

This project was created for the 2023 Solution Challenge by Google. We aim to raise the awareness of the importance of the recycling through gamification, visuals and information on the website.

While creating the platform, we used the following technologies:

- React & Next.js
- PWA (offline access, push notifications)
- Firebase (authentication, database)
- Netlify (hosting)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Framer Motion (animations)

and various sources of information for recycling tips and statistics.
